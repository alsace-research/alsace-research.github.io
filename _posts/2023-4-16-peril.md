This blog post presents our approach to analyzing tornado risk using data engineering techniques and its practical application in a business context. We leverage geographic data to obtain detailed actuarial statistics for assessing financial risks across a portfolio of assets, specifically focusing on real estate assets.

### **Tornado Statistics for Underwriting**
***`annual_probabilities`*** **is a measure of how often tornado events occur in a particular hexagon, on average.**
 * It is calculated by *dividing the total number of tornado events in a hexagon by the sum of the years difference between each event*.
 * This measure is computed by dividing the total number of tornado events in a hexagon by the sum of the time differences between each event.
 * For instance, if a hexagon experienced 5 tornado events with time differences of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, the sum of the time differences would be 15. 
 * Consequently, the average frequency of tornado events in this hexagon would be 5/15 or 0.33 events per year on average.

### **Expected Loss**

In the insurance industry, the **Annual Expected Loss (AEL)** equation is a statistical tool used to ***estimate the amount of money an insurer is likely to pay out in claims over a year***. It is calculated by multiplying the Probability of Loss (PoL) by the Expected Loss Amount (ELA).

Mathematically, the equation for Annual Expected Loss is:
 * **AEL = PoL x ELA**


where:
 * **PoL** is the ***probability of a loss*** occurring within a given period of time (usually one year)
 * **ELA** is the ***expected loss amount*** for a single loss event
To calculate the Annual Expected Loss, an insurer will typically use ***historical data*** to estimate the PoL and ELA for a particular type of insurance policy  (Rejda & McNamara, 2021). 
 * The **insurer** may also factor in other variables, such as the level of risk associated with a particular policy, to refine their estimate of the AEL. By estimating the AEL, insurers can ***better understand the potential financial impact of insuring a particular risk*** and set appropriate premium rates to cover their expected losses (Rejda & McNamara, 2021).


Other calculations to be made...
 * Value at Risk (VaR)

```
import numpy as np

# Assuming a normal distribution, we will use the scipy library for VaR calculation
from scipy.stats import norm

# Confidence level (e.g., 95%)
confidence_level = 0.95

# Calculate portfolio loss distribution (sum of expected losses)
portfolio_loss_distribution = df['expected_loss'].sum()

# Calculate standard deviation of the portfolio loss distribution
# You can use historical data or other methods to estimate the standard deviation
portfolio_loss_std_dev = np.std(df['expected_loss'])

# Calculate VaR at the specified confidence level
VaR = norm.ppf(confidence_level, loc=portfolio_loss_distribution, scale=portfolio_loss_std_dev)

print("Value at Risk (VaR):", VaR)
```

 * Tail Value at Risk (TVaR)

```
# Calculate TVaR at the specified confidence level
# First, we need to find the probability density function (PDF) value at VaR
pdf_at_VaR = norm.pdf(VaR, loc=portfolio_loss_distribution, scale=portfolio_loss_std_dev)

# Then, we calculate the tail probability beyond VaR (1 - confidence level)
tail_probability = 1 - confidence_level

# Finally, we calculate the TVaR using the formula: VaR + (pdf_at_VaR / tail_probability)
TVaR = VaR + (pdf_at_VaR / tail_probability)

print("Tail Value at Risk (TVaR):", TVaR)
```

### **Tornado Risk of Arkansas Real Estate properties**

- ***The map above shows real estate properties that have encountered at least 1 tornado (up to 7) in a 90-year period.***  
- ***Black symbols show real estate that has not encountered an tornado.***


 * In the accompanying map, we illustrate real estate properties that have encountered at least one tornado (up to seven) within a 90-year period. 
 * The properties that have not encountered any tornadoes are represented by black symbols. 
 * The map also highlights the real estate properties most at risk, displayed in yellow. 
 * It is important to note that real estate located in areas prone to tornadoes is more likely to incur losses.

* we look up each property and return a precise tornado probability score
* `annual_probability` has a *geographic precision* of **110m^2**
* basis for the `expected_annual_loss` equation
