In this blog post, we'll be discussing our approach to the tornado peril and how that changes our approach.

We rely on geographic data to make this happen and the end result gives us actuarial statistics to quanitfy risk to an portfolio of assets.

For the example, we'll be looking at a portfolio of real estate assets.

<p>Let's take a look at implementing these metrics in your own workflow</p>
<div class="row">
	<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Average Frequency</h3>
		<p>The avg_frequency is a measure of how often tornado events occur in a particular hexagon, on average. It is calculated by dividing the total number of tornado events in a hexagon by the sum of the years difference between each event.

For example, suppose we have a hexagon with 5 tornado events, and the years difference between each event is 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. The sum of the years difference is 1+2+3+4+5=15. So the average frequency of tornado events in this hexagon would be 5/15=0.33 events per year, on average.

		<h3>Financial Risk</h3>
		<p>We can then calculate things like expected loss
        
    def calculate_expected_loss(insured_values, tornado_probabilities):
    expected_losses = [value * probability for value, probability in zip(insured_values, tornado_probabilities)]
        return expected_losses

    def calculate_total_expected_los (expected_losses):
        total_expected_loss = sum(expected_losses)
        return total_expected_loss

    def calculate_total_value(insured_values):
        total_value = sum(insured_values)
        return total_value

    def calculate_expected_loss_percentage(total_expected_loss, total_value):
        expected_loss_percentage = (total_expected_loss / total_value) * 100
        return expected_loss_percentage

    # Example usage:
    insured_values = [100000, 200000, 150000, 300000] # Insured values of assets in the portfolio
    tornado_probabilities = [0.01, 0.02, 0.015, 0.005] # Probability of a tornado event for each asset

    expected_losses = calculate_expected_loss(insured_values, tornado_probabilities)
    total_expected_loss = calculate_total_expected_loss(expected_losses)
    total_value = calculate_total_value(insured_values)
    expected_loss_percentage = calculate_expected_loss_percentage(total_expected_loss, total_value)

    print("Expected losses:", expected_losses)
    print("Total expected loss:", total_expected_loss)
    print("Total value of assets:", total_value)
    print("Expected loss percentage:", expected_loss_percentage)
