### **Air Quality Statistics for Real Estate**
***`annual_probabilities`*** **is a measure of how often tornado events occur in a particular hexagon, on average.**
 * It is calculated by *dividing the total number of tornado events in a hexagon by the sum of the years difference between each event*.
 * ***For example***, suppose we have a hexagon with 5 tornado events, and the years difference between each event is 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. 
 * The sum of the years difference is 1+2+3+4+5=15. 
 * The average frequency of tornado events in this hexagon would be 5/15=0.33 events per year, on average.
