Alsace Research has been involved in oil and gas, regional banking, agriculture, and insurance-reinsurance.  Our approach aims to be a generalist approach, beliving that multiple industries experience the same problems that warrant simplified solutions.  

This is important as it reduces redundancy on projects that impact the workforce, maintenance over time, and cost over time.

Here are a few showcases of prior work:
