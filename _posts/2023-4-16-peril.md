In this blog post, we'll be discussing our approach to the tornado peril and how that changes our approach.

We rely on geographic data to make this happen and the end result gives us actuarial statistics to quanitfy risk to an portfolio of assets.

For the example, we'll be looking at a portfolio of real estate assets.

        The avg_frequency is a measure of how often tornado events occur in a particular hexagon, on average. It is calculated by dividing the total number of tornado events in a hexagon by the sum of the years difference between each event.
        For example, suppose we have a hexagon with 5 tornado events, and the years difference between each event is 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. The sum of the years difference is 1+2+3+4+5=15. So the average frequency of tornado events in this hexagon would be 5/15=0.33 events per year, on average.</p>
