### **Leveraging Uber H3 Indexes for Precise Risk Management in Real Estate**
<br>

***Consider an $80 billion portfolio spread across various regions with differing levels of tornado risk***. Traditional risk assessment methods would broadly categorize properties in tornado-prone regions, ***leading to higher insurance premiums and potential loss in revenues***. But what if there was a way to fine-tune this assessment?

Uber H3, a hexagonal hierarchical spatial index, offers the ability to aggregate geospatial data at a granular level. This tool enables a precise evaluation of properties at risk, allowing for smarter decisions on insurance and risk mitigation strategies.

**Let's take a look at how this could translate into significant cost savings**:


 * `total_assets_value` as the total value of the company's assets, $80 billion in this case.
 * `annual_damage_percent` as the annual percentage of the assets affected by tornado damage, which we'll assume is 15% based on historical data.




    ```python
    # Hypothetical historical data
    total_assets_value = 80000000000 # $80 billion
    annual_damage_percent = 0.15 # 15% of the assets affected annually
    average_annual_damage = total_assets_value * annual_damage_percent # Average insurance costs and repairs
    ```

 * `lower_risk_percent` as the percentage of properties that are actually at lower risk, even though they are in a high-risk region. We'll assume this is 40% based on the data from the Uber H3 index.

    ```python
    # Possible reduction in costs with Uber H3 indexes
    lower_risk_percent = 0.40 # 40% of properties at lower risk
    insurance_rate_reduction = 0.10 # 10% reduction in insurance costs for lower risk properties
    ```
 * `insurance_rate_reduction` as the percentage by which the company can reduce insurance costs for these lower risk properties. We'll assume a reduction of 10%.

    ```python
    # Calculation of savings
    annual_savings = average_annual_damage * lower_risk_percent * insurance_rate_reduction
    annual_savings

    annual_savings = $12 billion * 40% * 10% = $480 million
    ```

By using Uber H3 indexes, ***if the company could reduce the cost of insuring their lower risk properties by 10%, they could save around $40 million annually***, based on the above hypothetical scenario.

Thus, the implementation of Uber H3 indexes can transform the way risk assessment is conducted in real estate, leading to a potential game-changer in revenue management for large corporations with distributed assets.

## **How this intelligence can be applied**

 * **Investment in new properties**: The savings could be used to purchase and develop properties in areas identified as lower risk.
 * **Enhanced protection for high-risk properties**: The savings could be invested in protective measures for properties that are identified as high-risk, potentially preventing future damage and reducing insurance claims.
 * **Diversification of asset**s: The savings could be used to diversify the company's property portfolio, spreading the risk across different types of properties and regions.
 * **Paying down debt**: The savings could be used to reduce any existing debt, thereby reducing interest payments and freeing up more capital for investment.
 * **Return to shareholders**: The savings could be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks, potentially increasing the attractiveness of the company to investors.
 * **Investment in other areas of the business**: The savings could be used to fund other areas of the business, such as research and development, marketing, or staff training, potentially leading to increased revenue in the long term.


```python
# Using Blackstone as an example

total_assets_value = 279900000000  # $279.9 billion in assets

# Portfolio distribution
commercial_percent = 0.40
residential_percent = 0.30
office_percent = 0.20
other_percent = 0.10

# Insurance costs for each portfolio type
insurance_costs_percent_commercial = 0.0012
insurance_costs_percent_residential = 0.0008
insurance_costs_percent_office = 0.0010
insurance_costs_percent_other = 0.0006

# Total annual insurance costs for each portfolio type
annual_insurance_costs_commercial = total_assets_value * commercial_percent * insurance_costs_percent_commercial
annual_insurance_costs_residential = total_assets_value * residential_percent * insurance_costs_percent_residential
annual_insurance_costs_office = total_assets_value * office_percent * insurance_costs_percent_office
annual_insurance_costs_other = total_assets_value * other_percent * insurance_costs_percent_other

# Total annual insurance costs
total_annual_insurance_costs = (annual_insurance_costs_commercial + annual_insurance_costs_residential +
                                annual_insurance_costs_office + annual_insurance_costs_other)

# Possible reduction in insurance costs with Uber H3 indexes
insurance_rate_reduction = 0.10  # Assuming 10% reduction in insurance costs

# Calculation of savings
total_annual_insurance_savings = total_annual_insurance_costs * insurance_rate_reduction

total_annual_insurance_savings = $279.9 million * 10% = $27.99 million
