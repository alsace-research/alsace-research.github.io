### *Commercial API is under construction.*
<br>

### **API access is available here:** [Alsace Research API](https://alsace-research-api.herokuapp.com/docs#/)

We provide our clients with access to our commercial API.  We use this method to standardize and simplify how clients obtain our insights and integrate Alsace Research data products into their own systems.

The API spans a number of industries and domains:
* Finance
* Catastrophe Modeling
* Geographic Diversification Index
* Climate Risk
* Climate Histories
* Climate Extremes 
* Geocoding
* Retail Optimization

We provide data products from proprietary models that have been statistically tested.  Our models aim to provide modern R&D that companies can quickly import direct into their existing models and workflows.
