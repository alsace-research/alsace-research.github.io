Sure, I can provide you with examples of basic data structures commonly taught in computer science and software engineering programs, along with an explanation of their major themes and applications in real-world code at big tech companies. Here are five fundamental data structures, demonstrated using Python:

1. Arrays:
Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory that store elements of the same type. In Python, lists are used as dynamic arrays. Lists are versatile and allow you to perform various operations such as indexing, slicing, and appending.

Example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[0])  # Accessing the first element
my_list.append(6)  # Adding an element to the list
```

Major themes:
- Fast random access (O(1) for indexing)
- Dynamic resizing (in Python)

Real-world application:
Arrays are used extensively in big tech companies for tasks such as storing and manipulating large datasets, implementing basic data structures like stacks, and more.

2. Linked Lists:
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object called a node, and each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence.

Example:
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

# Creating a simple linked list
head = Node(1)
second = Node(2)
third = Node(3)

head.next = second
second.next = third
```

Major themes:
- Dynamic data structure
- Efficient insertions and deletions (O(1))
- No random access (O(n) for indexing)

Real-world application:
Linked lists are used in big tech companies for tasks such as implementing data structures with efficient insertions and deletions like stacks and queues, managing memory allocation, and more.

3. Stacks:
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end called the top of the stack.

Example:
```python
stack = []

stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
stack.append(3)

print(stack.pop())  # Removes and returns the top element (3)
```

Major themes:
- LIFO order
- Common operations: push, pop, peek

Real-world application:
Stacks are used in big tech companies for tasks such as managing function call stacks, parsing expressions, implementing undo/redo functionality, and more.

4. Queues:
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

Example:
```python
from collections import deque

queue = deque()

queue.append(1)
queue.append(2)
queue.append(3)

print(queue.popleft())  # Removes and returns the front element (1)
```

Major themes:
- FIFO order
- Common operations: enqueue, dequeue

Real-world application:
Queues are used in big tech companies for tasks such as managing tasks in a job queue, implementing breadth-first search, handling requests in web servers, and more.

5. Hash Tables:
A hash table (dictionary in Python) is a data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs and efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key.

Example:
```python
hash_table = {}

hash_table['one'] = 1
hash_table['two'] = 2
hash_table['three'] = 3

print(hash_table['two'])  # Accessing the value associated with the key 'two'
```

Major themes:
- Fast average-case insertion, deletion, and search (O(1))
- Hash functions and collision resolution

Certainly! Here are five fundamental algorithms commonly taught in computer science and software engineering programs, demonstrated using Python:

1. Binary Search:
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Example:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
target = 4
print(binary_search(arr, target))  # Output: 3
```

Major themes:
- Sorted input
- Divide and conquer
- Time complexity: O(log n)

Real-world application:
Binary search is used in big tech companies for tasks such as searching large datasets, optimizing database queries, and solving search-related problems.

2. Merge Sort:
Merge sort is an efficient and stable comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach.

Example:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])

    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0

    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1

    result += left[i:]
    result += right[j:]
    return result

arr = [5, 1, 8, 2, 4]
print(merge_sort(arr))  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
```

Major themes:
- Divide and conquer
- Time complexity: O(n log n)

Real-world application:
Merge sort is used in big tech companies for tasks such as sorting large datasets, implementing stable sorting in data processing pipelines, and optimizing database operations.

3. Depth-First Search (DFS):
DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Example:
```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}

def dfs(graph, node, visited):
    if node not in visited:
        print(node, end=' ')
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)

visited = set()
dfs(graph, 'A', visited)  # Output: A B D E F C
```

Major themes:
- Tree or graph traversal
- Recursion or stack-based implementation

Real-world application:
DFS is used in big tech companies for tasks such as searching complex data structures, solving maze and pathfinding problems, analyzing network connections, and more.

4. Breadth-First Search (BFS):
BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Apologies for that. Continuing with the example and major themes for Breadth-First Search (BFS):

Example:
```python
from collections import deque

graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node not in visited:
            print(node, end=' ')
            visited.add(node)
            queue.extend(neighbor for neighbor in graph[node])

bfs(graph, 'A')  # Output: A B C D E F
```

Major themes:
- Tree or graph traversal
- Queue-based implementation
- Level-by-level exploration

Real-world application:
BFS is used in big tech companies for tasks such as finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, solving various search-related problems, analyzing social networks, and more.

5. Dijkstra's Algorithm:
Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights, producing a shortest-path tree.

Example:
```python
import heapq

graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]

    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances

print(dijkstra(graph, 'A'))  # Output: {'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 3, 'D': 4}
```

Major themes:
- Graph traversal
- Greedy algorithm
- Priority queue

Real-world application:
Dijkstra's algorithm is used in big tech companies for tasks such as finding the shortest path in networks, routing algorithms, traffic navigation systems, and more.


Sure! Let's consider a simplified example of a data pipeline that processes logs generated by a web server at a big tech company. This pipeline uses a combination of data structures and algorithms, such as queues, hash tables, and sorting algorithms.

1. Data ingestion:
Web server logs are generated continuously, and they need to be ingested and processed in real-time. We can use a queue to manage the incoming logs, where logs are enqueued as they arrive and dequeued for processing.

```python
from collections import deque

logs_queue = deque()
```

2. Log processing:
Each log contains information such as IP address, timestamp, requested resource, and response status. We can use a hash table to store aggregated statistics for each unique IP address.

```python
stats = {}

def process_log(log):
    ip_address = log['ip_address']
    if ip_address not in stats:
        stats[ip_address] = {'count': 0, 'total_response_time': 0}
    stats[ip_address]['count'] += 1
    stats[ip_address]['total_response_time'] += log['response_time']
```

3. Regularly analyze statistics:
To analyze the statistics regularly, we can sort the IP addresses based on the request count or average response time. We can use a sorting algorithm like merge sort or any built-in sorting function provided by the programming language.

```python
def analyze_statistics():
    sorted_ips = sorted(stats.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]['count'], reverse=True)

    # You can also sort by average response time or any other criteria
    # sorted_ips = sorted(stats.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]['total_response_time'] / x[1]['count'], reverse=True)

    # Print the top 10 IP addresses
    for ip, data in sorted_ips[:10]:
        print(f"IP Address: {ip}, Request Count: {data['count']}, Total Response Time: {data['total_response_time']}")
```

4. Run the data pipeline:
To run the data pipeline, we can dequeue logs from the queue, process them, and periodically analyze the statistics.

```python
import time

def run_pipeline():
    while True:
        if logs_queue:
            log = logs_queue.popleft()
            process_log(log)

        # Periodically analyze statistics every minute
        if int(time.time()) % 60 == 0:
            analyze_statistics()
            time.sleep(1)
```

In this simplified example, we have used a queue for log ingestion, a hash table for processing and aggregating data, and a sorting algorithm for analyzing the aggregated statistics. In a real-world big tech company, more complex and distributed data structures and algorithms may be employed to handle the scale and performance requirements of the system.


I will provide solutions for two of the problems mentioned above. You can practice solving the other problems on your own.

1. Two Sum (Easy):

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_to_index = {}
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_to_index:
            return [num_to_index[complement], i]
        num_to_index[num] = i

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

6. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree (Medium):

First, let's define the TreeNode class:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

Now, let's implement the lowest_common_ancestor function:

```python
def lowest_common_ancestor(root, p, q):
    if not root or root == p or root == q:
        return root

    left = lowest_common_ancestor(root.left, p, q)
    right = lowest_common_ancestor(root.right, p, q)

    if left and right:
        return root
    return left if left else right

# Example usage:
# Construct the following binary tree:
#     3
#    / \
#   5   1
#  / \ / \
# 6  2 0  8
#   / \
#  7   4
root = TreeNode(3)
root.left = TreeNode(5)
root.right = TreeNode(1)
root.left.left = TreeNode(6)
root.left.right = TreeNode(2)
root.right.left = TreeNode(0)
root.right.right = TreeNode(8)
root.left.right.left = TreeNode(7)
root.left.right.right = TreeNode(4)

p = root.left      # Node with value 5
q = root.left.right.right  # Node with value 4
lca = lowest_common_ancestor(root, p, q)
print(lca.val)  # Output: 5
```

These are example solutions for the Two Sum and Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree problems. Remember that for coding interviews, it's essential to practice many problems and understand the underlying concepts to become proficient in solving algorithmic challenges.
