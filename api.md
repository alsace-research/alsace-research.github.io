*Commercial API is under construction.*

We provide our clients with access to our commercial API.  We use this method to standardize and simplify how clients obtain our insights and integrate Alsace Research data products into their own systems.

The API spans a number of industries and domains:
* Finance
* Catastrophe Modeling
* Geographic Diversification Index
* Climate Risk
* Climate Histories
* Climate Extremes 
* Geocoding
* Retail Optimization

We provide proprietary models that statistically tested.  Our models aim to provide modern R&D that companies can simplify import directly into their workflows.
