The company started after having worked on projects across petroleum, banking, precision agriculture, and insurance industries.  We were quickly surprised by how so many industries faced the same problems and each had their own solutions based on the expertise, experience, and creativity of the workforce they could maintain over time.  Those same problems can be solved with the same solution which cuts down on the overhead an employer has to pay and organize to maintain.  The aim is to solve universal problems and reduce technical debt that has plagued US corporations and businesses while giving options for modernizing or even just accessing the most modern tools as they're released.
